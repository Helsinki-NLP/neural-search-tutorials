Additional Notebooks for the Building NLP Applications course.

The notebooks require `gensim` to be installed.
One of the notebooks also assumes that the `glove-wiki-gigaword-200.gz` is available in the shared folder.

The `download.ipynb` notebook shows how to download the embeddings models with the Gensim API. The models are stored by default in `~/gensim-data/` but can be moved elsewhere.
