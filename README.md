Additional Notebooks for the Building NLP Applications course.

The notebooks require `gensim` to be installed.

The `download.ipynb` notebook shows how to download the embeddings models with the Gensim API. The models are stored by default in `~/gensim-data/` but can be moved elsewhere. The notebook `average_word_vectors.ipynb` expects the file `glove-wiki-gigaword-200.gz` in the shared folder (i.e., `~/shared/glove-wiki-gigaword-200.gz`), but the other models listed in `download.ipynb` are not required for the functioning of the notebooks.
